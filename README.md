# demo-profile
Demo of a social network type profile of users and Marvel characters that they follow.

Every time you open the app it's populated with random user data, which includes:

- background and profile photos
- name, location, birthday, relationship user (or single)
- whether it's your own profile or someone else's
- if someone else's, whether you've sent a request, are awaiting a response, have not interacted before or are friends already

and a random starting page of Marvel characters with pagination for more.

If on your own profile, you can unfollow characters and they will be removed.  If on someone else's, you can follow and unfollow from their list of followed characters.
